    description: "This poster was created to represent Intralinks at the UXPA 2016 conference. Kevin Markgren, a colleague, requested a 3' x 4' poster that would address a central theme for his talk: that our careers in UX are a journey, and they're strategicâ€”just like a game! My role was in selecting the color palettes, creating all the illustrations, and a large part of the layout of the board. Credits to Stefanie Bazarian, Kevin Markgren, Nicole Gerhard, and John Corsi. See here for more information on Kevin's talk.",
